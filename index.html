							<td>After 12 years of bucolic bliss, Mr. Fox breaks a promise to his wife  and raids the farms of their human neighbors, Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Giving in to his animal instincts endangers not only his marriage but also the lives of his family and their animal friends. When the farmers force Mr. Fox and company deep underground, he has to resort to his natural craftiness to rise above the opposition.</td>
							<td>Cast:<br>
								George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman<br>
								<br>
								Director:<br>
								Wes Anderson<br>
								<br>
								Duration: <u>87 minutes</u>
							</td>
							<td>Deborah Ross:<br>
								<span>The animation is beautiful, the attention to detail is a thing of wonder... but the story is a mess, the script is banal and, as visually stunning as it all is, it just doesn't seem to have any kind of soul.</span><br>
								<br>
								Jason Bailey:<br>
								<span>'Fantastic Mr. Fox' may be the purest distillation of Anderson's specific, inimitable style.</span></td>

							<td>Young Kubo's peaceful existence comes crashing down when he accidentally summons a vengeful spirit from the past. Now on the run, Kubo joins forces with Monkey and Beetle to unlock a secret legacy. Armed with a magical instrument, Kubo must battle the Moon King and other gods and monsters to save his family and solve the mystery of his fallen father, the greatest samurai warrior the world has ever known.</td>
							<td>Cast:<br>
								Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Ralph Fiennes<br>
								<br>
								Director:<br>
								Travis Knight<br>
								<br>
								Duration: <u>102 minutes</u>
							</td>
							<td>Tara Brady:<br>
								<span>Sweeping tableaux, a wonderful voice cast and adventure that feels genuinely folkloric make this a film that definitely deserves to be taken out of cellophane.</span><br>
								<br>
								Kate Miur:<br>
								<span>A glorious flight of the imagination.</span>
							</td>

							<td>The film follows the misadventures of Jack Skellington, Halloweentown's beloved pumpkin king, who has become bored with the same annual routine of frightening people in the "real world." When Jack accidentally stumbles on Christmastown, all bright colors and warm spirits, he gets a new lease on life -- he plots to bring Christmas under his control by kidnapping Santa Claus and taking over the role. But Jack soon discovers even the best-laid plans of mice and skeleton men can go seriously awry.</td>
							<td>Cast:<br>
								Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey<br>
								<br>
								Director:<br>
								Henry Selick<br>
								<br>
								Duration: <u>76 minutes</u>
							</td>
							<td>Chris Stuckmann:<br>
								<span>I'm blown away by just the construction of the scenes, and by all of the effects that have been incorporated to make everything move fluidly; and there's also this charming imperfection to the animation that just makes it so gorgeous.</span><br>
								<br>
								Kenneth Turan:<br>
								<span>Part avant-garde art film, part amusing but morbid fairy tale, it is a delightfully ghoulish holiday musical that displays more inventiveness in its brief 75 minutes than some studios can manage in an entire year.</span></td>
